 VBA challenge assignment

Both the VBAChallengeCode.vb and Both the VBAChallengeCode.vbs have the same code. The editor I used automatically saved it as .vb but I thought the file type needed was .vbs so I uploaded both file types with the same code.

For the screenshots, I took screenshots of the start and end of the output on each year.

I used a few resources for outside help that are also documented in the comments of the code.
